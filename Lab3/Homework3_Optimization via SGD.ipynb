    "# Optimization via Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "While working with Machine Learning (ML) you are usually given a dataset $D = {X, Y}$ with $X = [x^1 x^2 ... x^N] \\in \\mathbb{R^{dxN}}$ and $Y = [y^1 y^2 ... y^N] \\in \\mathbb{R^N}$ and a parametric function $f_w(x)$ where the vector $w$ is sually referred to as the weights of the model. The training procedure can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w^*=\\underset{w}{arg\\,min}\\;l(w; \\mathbb{D}) = \\underset{w}{arg\\,min\\;\\sum^N_{i=1} l_i(w; x^{(i)},y^{(i)})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "what is interesting from the optimization point of view, is that the objective function l(w; D) is written as a sum of independent terms that are related to datapoints (we will see in the next lab why this formulation is so common).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to apply GD. Given an initial vector $w_0 ∈ \\mathbb{R}^n$, the iteration become\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_{k+1}=w_k-\\alpha_k \\nabla_wl(w_k;\\mathbb{D})=w_k-\\alpha_k \\sum_{i=1}^N \\nabla_wl(w_k;x^{(i)},y^{(i)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, to compute the iteration we need the gradient with respect to the weights of the objective functions, that can be computed by summing up the gradients of the independent functions $l_i(w;x^{(i)},y^{(i)})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, even if it is easy to compute the gradient for each of the $l_i(w;x^{(i)},y^{(i)})$, when the number of samples N is large (which is common in Machine Learning), the computation of the full gradient $∇_wl(w_k; D)$ is prohibitive. For this reason, in such optimization problems, instead of using a standard GD algorithm, it is better using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method. That is a variant of the classical GD where, instead of computing $∇_wl(w; D) = \\sum^N_{i=1} ∇_wl_i(w; x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$, the summation is reduced to a limited numberof terms, called a batch. The idea is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a number $N_{batch}$ (usually called batch size), randomly extract a subdataset $M$ with $|M| = N_{batch}$ from $\\mathbb{D}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Approximate the true gradient \n",
    "    $$∇_wl(w; D) = \\sum^N_{i=1} ∇_wl_i(w; x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$$ \n",
    "    with \n",
    "    $$∇_wl(w; M) = \\sum_{i∈\\mathbb{M}} ∇_wl_i(w; x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute one single iteration of the GD algorithm\n",
    "$$w_{k+1} = w_k − α_k∇_wl(w;M)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repeat until you have extracted the full dataset. Notice that the random sampling at each iteration is done without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration of the algorithm above is usually called batch iteration. When the whole dataset has been\n",
    "processed, we say that we completed an epoch of the SGD method. This algorithm should be repeated for e\n",
    "fixed number E of epochs to reach convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, one of the biggest drawbacks of SGD with respect to GD, is that now we cannot check the\n",
    "convergence anymore (since we can’t obviously compute the gradient of $l(w; D)$ to check its distance from\n",
    "zero) and we can’t use the backtracking algorithm, for the same reason. As a consequence, the algorithm\n",
    "will stop ONLY after reaching the fixed number of epochs, and we must set a good value for the step size\n",
    "αk by hand. Those problems are solved by recent algorithms like SGD with Momentum, Adam, AdaGrad, ..."
